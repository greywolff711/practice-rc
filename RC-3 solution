Question Explanation:
The question asks which of the provided inferences is not supported by the details in the passage about surrealism and its reception, especially in Britain. To determine the correct answer, we need to critically analyse each statement and check whether there is information in the passage that supports or refutes it. The aim is to find the statement that lacks support from the passage.
Correct Answer:
4. “the failure of surrealism in Britain is due to the disillusionment towards modernity.” This statement posits that a general disillusionment with modernity led to the failure of surrealism in Britain. The passage, however, offers different reasons for the resistance to surrealism in Britain, notably its un-English character and alignment with perceived degenerate art, alongside a cultural preference for more traditional art forms post-war. The text mentions surrealism’s political and revolutionary nature and its misalignment with prevailing cultural and artistic norms in Britain but does not link its failure specifically to disillusionment with modernity as a broader concept. Thus, this option is not supported by the passage, and it is the correct answer.
Incorrect Answer:
1. “there were instances of cultural resistance to art that challenged the norm.” This inference is well-supported by multiple examples in the passage. It describes how Salvador Dali’s lecture in a diving suit was perceived as a practical joke, indicating resistance to surrealism’s unconventional methods. Furthermore, the attack on Dali’s painting in Glasgow by an individual with an umbrella underscores direct physical resistance against art that challenged societal norms.
2. “founders of surrealism were marketers of their own style.” The passage explicitly supports this inference by detailing how surrealism was as much a literary as an artistic movement at its inception, which produced effective publicity for itself. The mention of surrealist founders and their active promotion of the movement, including through grand events like the International Surrealist Exhibition, illustrates their role as marketers of their artistic style.
3. “post-war Britain saw a societal retreat to more conservative art forms.” The text supports this statement by describing the post-war preference for social realism and the kitchen-sink variety, which are more conservative and traditional compared to the avant-garde and revolutionary nature of surrealism. This shift in artistic preference shows a societal retreat to more conventional forms, contrasting sharply with the earlier experimental phase represented by surrealism.

Question Explanation:
The question seeks to identify the significance of two surreal images mentioned in the passage: ‘lobsters on telephone cradles’ and ‘clock-faces that flop over table-ends like soft-fried eggs.’ To answer accurately, we must interpret these images within the context provided by the passage, focusing on how they exemplify the principles and artistic methods of surrealism as described.
Correct Answer:
1. “descriptions of paintings depicted in surrealist art” is the correct choice. The surreal images mentioned are typical of the surrealist art movement, characterised by bizarre, dream-like scenarios that challenge conventional reality. The passage discusses surrealism as originating from a blend of literary and artistic movements, known for its striking and unconventional imagery intended to disrupt the mundane perception of reality. These specific images—though not directly tied to known works of Dali within the text—serve as quintessential examples of how surrealism manifests in visual art: placing everyday objects in unexpected, irrational contexts to create a jarring, dream-like effect. This interpretation aligns with the overall description of surrealism in the passage, highlighting its aim to subvert and redefine reality through art.
Incorrect Answer:
2. “depiction of the fluidity of human perception” could be inferred as a secondary theme in surrealism, as the movement often explores the boundaries of perception and reality. However, the passage does not specifically connect these images to the concept of fluid perception. Instead, it focuses more on the visual and thematic shock value of surrealism, rather than a philosophical or psychological exploration of perception.
3. “misunderstood artworks of surrealism” is not directly supported because the passage does not imply that these particular images were misunderstood. It suggests that surrealism itself faced resistance and was seen as controversial, but it does not attribute misunderstanding specifically to these images. The discussion centres more on surrealism’s impact and reception rather than public misinterpretation of specific artworks.
4. “examples of the French word surréalisme” is incorrect because it misinterprets the role of these images. While the passage explains that surrealism translates to ‘super-realism,’ these images do not serve as examples of the word but illustrate the style and artistic approach of surrealism. They are not linguistic examples but visual demonstrations of surrealism’s core artistic principles.


Question Explanation:
This question requires identifying which statement about Britain’s relationship with surrealism, as described in the passage, is true. The question asks us to isolate the one accurate description among options that are otherwise untrue based on the passage’s content.
Correct Answer:
2. “Britain tends to adopt artistic movements only after they are no longer cutting-edge.” This is the correct choice, as the passage directly supports this notion by detailing how surrealism was not readily accepted or popular in Britain until it was “safely passé.” The passage also illustrates that Britain was generally late in engaging with surrealism compared to much of Europe, with significant interest only beginning around the 1936 exhibition. The broader context of the passage suggests a pattern where Britain is resistant to avant-garde movements until they lose their revolutionary edge, aligning with this statement.
Incorrect Answer:
1. “Britain suppressed surrealistic art as it was seen as a threat to the cultural fabric.” The passage does not claim that surrealistic art was actively suppressed due to being viewed as a threat. Instead, it mentions resistance and lack of acceptance, which is different from an organised or governmental suppression aimed at protecting cultural fabric.
3. “Britain saw the rebellious young favouring surrealism despite societal resistance.”
The passage contradicts this statement by noting that even the rebellious young favoured social realism over surrealism in the post-war period. It highlights a societal inclination towards more conservative and traditional forms like the kitchen-sink variety, rather than a preference for surrealism among the youth.
4. “Britain’s version of surrealism aimed at disrupting the prevalent political landscape.”
Although surrealism had political undertones and was seen as revolutionary elsewhere, the passage does not indicate that the British adoption of surrealism had a deliberate aim to disrupt the political landscape. The focus in Britain seems more on surrealism’s cultural and artistic aspects rather than its political implications.



Question Explanation:
This question centres on why the author references Goebbels’ “Entartete Kunst” (degenerate art) in relation to surrealism. Understanding the context in which this term is used helps clarify its function in the discussion about surrealism’s reception and impact, particularly in fascist countries.
Correct Answer:
3. “highlight the exclusion of surrealism from the norms of fascist nations.”
This choice is the most accurate based on the passage. The mention of Goebbels’ Entartete Kunst serves to illustrate the ideological and cultural rejection of surrealism by the fascist regimes of Germany, Spain, and Italy. The passage notes that surrealism was categorised as degenerate art, which implies a strong, official disapproval and exclusion from the accepted cultural norms under these regimes. This term specifically connotes the Nazi regime’s campaign against what it deemed culturally corrupt or politically undesirable art, effectively categorising surrealism as unacceptable within their cultural policy.
Incorrect Answer:
1. “illustrate the fascist axis’ condemnation of ideologies such as Marxism.”
While it’s true that fascist regimes condemned Marxism and associated ideologies, the specific mention of Entartete Kunst in the passage focuses on the art movement itself, not directly on its ideological ties to Marxism. The term is used more to discuss the cultural policy toward art than a broad ideological condemnation.
2. “present how fascist regimes amended surrealism to suit their dogmas.”
This statement is incorrect as there is no indication in the passage that fascist regimes attempted to amend or adapt surrealism to fit their ideologies. Instead, they outright rejected it as part of their broader rejection of certain modernist art forms. 4. “underscore the failure of surrealism to have a widespread impact.”
Although surrealism’s limited impact in certain regions is a theme in the passage, the specific reference to Entartete Kunst is not used to underscore its overall failure but rather to highlight its rejection by specific totalitarian regimes. The context of this mention is more about rejection and exclusion than about the general success or failure of the movement.

Question Explanation:
This question seeks to identify which statement, if true, would best complement and support the findings discussed in the passage about baleen whales’ use of their dual blowholes for enhanced olfactory capabilities. The passage focuses on how the architectural differences in blowholes among whales relate to their sensory and behavioural adaptations, particularly how baleen whales may use their dual blowholes for “stereo smelling” to locate food sources.
Correct Answer:
2. “Baleen whales adjust their migratory routes based on seasonal variations in the concentration of dimethyl sulphide in oceanic regions.”
This statement, if true, directly complements the passage’s discussion about the sensory use of blowholes in baleen whales. The passage describes how baleen whales might detect chemical signals, specifically dimethyl sulphide, to find rich feeding sites. If these whales adjust their migratory patterns based on variations in the concentration of this chemical, it will provide strong support for the hypothesis that baleen whales use their sense of smell, facilitated by their dual blowholes, to locate their primary food sources. This behavioural adaptation would demonstrate the practical application of their olfactory capabilities in their natural migration and feeding strategies, aligning perfectly with the passage’s focus.
Incorrect Answer:
1. “Baleen whales increase the frequency of their vocalizations when in the presence of high concentrations of zooplankton.”
While interesting, this option would relate more to the study of acoustic communication or echolocation rather than olfactory capabilities. The passage primarily discusses the potential for stereo-smelling through blowholes, not vocal or acoustic behaviours.
3. “Baleen whales exhibit a consistent preference for navigating between shallow coastal waters and deep oceanic environments.”
This statement, although relevant to the general behaviour of baleen whales, does not directly complement the findings about their olfactory capabilities or the specific use of their blowholes for smelling. It’s more about their geographical preferences rather than sensory or navigational strategies based on smell.
4. “Baleen whales demonstrate the capability to selectively close one blowhole to enhance water filtration through their baleen plates during feeding.”
This choice, although it pertains to the functionality of the blowholes, focuses more on their role in physical feeding mechanisms rather than their sensory use in detecting chemical cues in the environment. The passage is more concerned with how the blowholes assist in smelling, not in feeding processes directly.



Question Explanation:
This question requires us to identify which statement cannot be inferred from the specifics of Dr. Ryan’s study as described in the passage. The focus is on determining which assertion about the sensory abilities or behaviours of whales, particularly regarding their use of blowholes for olfactory sensing, is not supported by the study’s findings.
Correct Answer:
4. “Baleen whales can use olfactory cues to feed on any zooplankton congregations.”
This option is the correct answer because it extends the specific findings of Dr. Ryan’s study beyond what is supported by the passage. While the study details how baleen whales use their dual blowholes to detect large congregations of zooplankton effectively, it is specified that these large congregations likely release more detectable levels of dimethyl sulphide. This chemical serves as a cue for the whales to locate dense food sources. The passage does not provide information to support the idea that baleen whales can use their olfactory cues to detect any zooplankton congregations, regardless of size. The specif ic mention of “large congregations” suggests a dependency on a certain threshold of chemical signals, which may not be present in smaller congregations.
Incorrect Answer:
1. “Killer whales do not rely primarily on stereo-smelling to hunt their prey.”
This statement can be inferred with a reasonable degree of certainty. The passage explicitly states, “For instance, toothed whales such as dolphins and killer whales have a single blowhole, which is ideal for quick, frequent surfacing,” and “Unlike their toothed relatives, who employ echolocation to hunt down each prey, baleen whales are likely to utilize olfactory cues to locate large congregations of zooplankton.” These descriptions strongly suggest that killer whales, being toothed whales, primarily use echolocation rather than stereo-smelling for hunting, which is aligned with their anatomical feature of having a single blowhole not suited for stereo-smelling.
2. “The distance between blowholes correlates with the whale species’ primary diet.”
This statement can be inferred directly from the study, as Dr. Ryan’s analysis found a correlation between the spacing of the blowholes and the primary diet of different whale species. The study suggests that species feeding primarily on large congregations of zooplankton have blowholes that are set further apart, presumably to enhance their olfactory capability.
3. “Sense of sound does not play much role in baleen whales’ foraging behaviour.” This inference is strongly supported by the passage. It contrasts the foraging behaviours of toothed and baleen whales, noting that baleen whales likely utilize olfactory cues rather than echolocation (sound-based sensing) to locate zooplankton. This distinction underscores a reduced role for auditory sensing in the foraging strategies of baleen whales.


Question Explanation:
This question invites us to consider which potential implications about the sensory capabilities of baleen whales could logically extend from Dr. Conor Ryan’s findings, as discussed in the passage. Each option presents a hypothesis that builds on the study’s core assertion regarding the use of stereo-smelling in baleen whales to navigate and locate food sources.
Correct Answer:
1. “The stereo-smelling capability of baleen whales may allow them to discern not only the presence but also the density of zooplankton clusters at varying depths.”
This statement is a logical and plausible extension of Dr. Ryan’s findings. If baleen whales can use their dual blowholes to perform stereo-smelling, enhancing their ability to detect the direction and distance of scent gradients, it follows that they might also be able to gauge the density of these clusters. The idea that they could assess zooplankton density would naturally fit with the functionality of being able to smell in ‘stereo,’ which could provide nuanced information about the concentration of chemicals like dimethyl sulphide released by the zooplankton. This capability would be critical in determining not just the location but also the worthiness of potential feeding sites, especially in varying depths where different densities might indicate the richness of the food source.
Incorrect Answer:
2. “Baleen whales’ stereo-smelling might be complemented by a lesser-known auditory system that helps pinpoint the exact location of zooplankton swarms.”
While this is an interesting hypothesis, it does not directly extend from Dr. Ryan’s findings about olfactory capabilities. The passage specifically contrasts the sensory reliance of baleen whales on olfaction over echolocation (commonly associated with auditory capabilities in marine mammals), making this extension a bit speculative without additional context linking their olfactory and auditory systems.
3. “Baleen whales could potentially adjust their diving depth based on the clarity of the water to maximize visual perception of zooplankton.”
This suggestion introduces a visual component that is not covered by Dr. Ryan’s study, which focuses on olfactory capabilities. There’s no evidence in the passage to support an extension into visual adaptations or behaviours related to water clarity.
4. “Baleen whales might exhibit the ability to recognize individual chemical signatures of different species of zooplankton, enabling them to choose specific prey.”
This is an intriguing possibility and could be a natural extension of sophisticated olfactory capabilities. However, recognizing individual chemical signatures would require a level of sensory specificity and cognitive processing not discussed in the passage, making this extension more of a conjecture without direct support from the stated findings about general olfactory capabilities.


Question Explanation:
This question aims to identify which capability of baleen whales, as discussed in the passage, is not described or supported. To correctly answer, we analyze each option against the information provided in the passage to discern which capability is not mentioned or inferred.
Correct Answer:
3. “capable of using blowholes to hunt highly mobile marine species.”
This statement is the correct choice as it is not supported by the passage. The passage focuses on how baleen whales use their blowholes primarily for enhanced olfactory capabilities to detect chemical signals released by zooplankton, which are relatively stationary as they feed on phytoplankton. The passage does not discuss or imply that baleen whales use their blowholes in any direct way to hunt mobile marine species. This capability, involving hunting more agile or mobile prey, contrasts sharply with the described feeding behaviour of sweeping through the water to capture zooplankton, which is not described as highly mobile.
Incorrect Answer:
1. “can hunt their prey even in dirty waters.”
This capability is indirectly supported by the passage, which discusses the baleen whales’ ability to detect chemical signals in murky, visually obscure waters using their stereo-smelling ability provided by their dual blowholes. This suggests they can effectively locate food sources in lessthan- clear water conditions.
2. “their blowholes allow them to maintain their large size.”
While not explicitly stated, this can be reasonably inferred from the passage. It mentions that baleen whales have two blowholes, which allow them to inhale a greater volume of air to support their large bodies. This structural adaptation is critical for their filter-feeding lifestyle and maintaining their size, as it enhances their efficiency in breathing while feeding on large amounts of zooplankton.
4. “has evolutionary advantage due to distinctive adaptations.”
This is a core theme of the passage, which details various evolutionary adaptations, such as the development of dual blowholes for enhanced olfactory detection and the ability to feed efficiently on zooplankton, contributing to their success in marine ecosystems.

Question Explanation:
This question asks us to infer a characteristic of swarm systems based on the passage provided. Each of the four answer choices suggests something that swarm systems might lack. The task requires understanding the organizational and operational attributes of swarm systems as described in the passage.
Correct Answer:
4. lack principal coordinating unit. The passage explicitly mentions that in swarm systems, there is no “center of control,” and that “the management and heart of the system are said to be decentrally distributed within the system.” This description indicates that while these systems have some form of internal organization and management, they do not have a single, central coordinating unit controlling their operations. This directly supports the assertion made in option (4).
Incorrect Answer:
1. lack organizational structure: This option is incorrect because the passage describes swarm systems as having a decentralized but definite organizational structure. They consist of highly connected, autonomous members forming a peer network. This implies an organized structure, albeit not a traditionally hierarchical one.
2. lack direction in operation: This choice could be misleading. The passage describes the operations in swarm systems as unpredictable and lacking a centralized command, which might suggest a lack of directedness. However, the presence of local rules and interconnections between autonomous members provides a form of operational direction. Thus, while their operations are complex and decentralized, it is not accurate to say they completely lack direction.
3. lack management system: Like option (1), this is misleading because the passage does not claim an absence of management. Instead, it notes that management is decentralized—spread throughout the system rather than centralized. This implies a different style of management rather than no management at all.



Question Explanation:
This question asks for an interpretation of the term “moreness” as used in the passage. It’s critical to understand the context in which “moreness” is discussed to infer its most likely implication among the provided options. The term seems to be related to the complexity and functionality of systems, particularly in contrast between sequential and parallel operations.
Correct Answer:
2. how well a system can amplify capabilities beyond individual component functions.
The passage contrasts two types of system structures—sequential and parallel (swarm systems)—and describes how the latter operates without a central command, involving numerous autonomous components interacting in a complex, interconnected manner. This description suggests that “moreness” in this context refers to the ability of the system to perform at a level greater than the sum of its parts, where the collective actions and interdependencies amplify the system’s overall capabilities. This interpretation directly aligns with option (2), which talks about amplifying capabilities beyond individual functions.
Incorrect Answer:
1. how well a system should be structured so as to enhance autonomy and efficiency:
While the passage discusses autonomous components and possibly ef ficiency in a decentralized structure, “moreness” isn’t directly tied to structure for enhancing autonomy and efficiency. It’s more about outcome and capability rather than structure itself.
3. how well a system may be designed to be capable of having more sophisticated control: This option is incorrect as the passage actually moves away from traditional notions of control (e.g., centralized and sophisticated control systems) and instead emphasizes decentralized control and autonomous interactions, which doesn’t align with the idea of “more sophisticated control.”
4. how well a system enhances the parts of the whole as opposed to the sum of the whole: This option misinterprets “moreness”. The passage implies that “moreness” is about the capabilities that emerge from the sum of the interactions of the parts, rather than enhancing individual parts in isolation.





This question presents a negative prompt, asking which statement is not contradicted by the passage, i.e., which statement is implied by the passage. Each option must be evaluated against the content of the passage to determine which one aligns with the text without being negated by any argument therein.
Correct Answer:
3. there is a trend towards that machines may need to operate in ways that are not always perfectly controlled. The passage discusses the shift from traditional, predictable, and controlled systems (like clocks) to more complex and less predictable systems (like swarm systems or networks). It specifically suggests that for some tasks where adaptability is crucial, “out-of -control swarmware” is preferable, indicating a move towards systems that operate in less controlled, more autonomous manners. This clearly supports the implication in option (3) that there’s a trend towards machines operating in ways that aren’t always tightly controlled.
Incorrect Answer:
1. for autonomous systems, coordination among members plays a minor role in the system’s functionality. This option is incorrect because the passage implies the opposite; it highlights the importance of coordination and interaction among autonomous members in systems like neural networks or ant colonies. Coordination among members is crucial to the functionality of these systems, not minor.
2. systems that use sequential operations have little utility in situations where causal connections are important. This statement is incorrect as per the passage’s content. The passage mentions that sequential systems, like clocks, follow a logical sequence of operations, which would be essential in contexts where precise causal relationships are important. Therefore, this statement is directly contradicted by the passage.
4. real-life systems are either based on sequential operations or based on parallel operations. This option oversimplifies the description given in the passage. While the passage discusses these two types of systems, it does not imply that all real-life systems strictly fall into one of these categories alone, making this a false dichotomy and not implied by the passage.





This question asks which of the listed potential disadvantages of swarm systems is not supported by the passage. The goal is to identify which statement, based on the passage’s description of swarm systems, does not align with the discussed characteristics and functionalities of these systems.
Correct Answer:
3. failure of individual components could disrupt the whole system. The passage describes swarm systems as comprising many autonomous, interconnected components without a central controlling unit. Such systems, characterized by decentralized management and no single point of failure, typically do not rely on any single component such that its failure would disrupt the entire system. Instead, the resilience of these systems usually lies in their distributed functionality, meaning the failure of one component does not necessarily impact the entire system significantly.
Incorrect Answer:
1. it is difficult to understand exactly how it functions. This is a likely disadvantage implied by the passage, as it describes the operations within swarm systems as a “messy cascade of interdependent events,” suggesting complexity and diff iculty in comprehending the entire system’s functionality.
2. there could be a duplication of effort by the individual component. Given the autonomous nature of each component in a swarm system, as described in the passage, it’s plausible that without centralized control, dif ferent components might independently undertake similar tasks, leading to duplication of efforts. This fits with the general characteristics of decentralized systems.
4. it cannot be used in situations where foreseeability is important. The passage suggests that swarm systems, unlike sequential systems like clocks, do not operate on predictable, discrete cause-and-effect mechanics but rather on complex, simultaneous actions. This implies that swarm systems might not be suitable for scenarios where predictability and foreseeability are crucial, making this a probable disadvantage.
