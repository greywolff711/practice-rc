Nursery rhymes, often relegated to the margins of serious literary inquiry, in fact embody dense layers of linguistic rhythm, cultural memory, and aesthetic play tailored to young minds. As integral components of children's literature, they occupy a space where form and function are inextricable- shaped not only by sound and imagery but by the perceptual expectations of their audience. In translation studies, especially within the context of cross-cultural children's literature, these qualities demand scrutiny not merely at the linguistic level but at the level of aesthetic reception.... This study, using the English translation of Bronze and Sunflower as a representative case, argues that the nursery rhyme, far from being a trivial poetic form, is both a container of regional cultural essence and a barometer of child reader responsiveness. Its translation, therefore, must navigate not only formal and semantic fidelity but the preservation of rhythm, tone, and emotional resonance as perceived by children from different cultural frameworks....

Reception aesthetics, a postmodern theoretical development originating in Germany and shaped by Gadamer's hermeneutics, relocates the focus of literary analysis from the producer to the receiver-shifting the axis of meaning from authorial intent to reader interpretation.... Applied to nursery rhyme translation, this framework challenges the adult-centric abstraction that often dominates cross-linguistic adaptation. Rather than relying on adult logic or literalism, translation efforts must instead privilege the sensory, rhythmic, and emotive dimensions that align with the cognitive and imaginative capacities of children. This is crucial, given that young readers engage with texts more through sound, image, and playful repetition than through abstract reasoning.

Historically, Chinese children's literature has undergone significant evolution in its conception of audience. From the early 20th-century "children-oriented" reformist impulses of Lu Xun and Zhou Zuoren, through Mao Dun's vision of literature as a tool for societal education, to the post-1980s belief-espoused by writers like Cao Wenxuan-that children's literature helps mould national character, there has been a consistent move towards centring the child's perspective.... This trajectory reinforces the need for translations that retain the original's child-specific aesthetic flavour rather than neutralising or diluting it for broader, often adult-centric, comprehensibility.

English and Chinese nursery rhymes differ across syntax, structure, and cultural coding, yet both share commonalities in rhythmicity and intent. In translating rhymes from Chinese to English or vice versa, translators confront a fundamental tension: how to preserve melodic cadence and imagery when phonetic systems, cultural referents, and poetic conventions diverge. The translation of Bronze and Sunflower.. .exemplifies this challenge-striving to retain sentence patterns and thematic rhythms while deploying compensatory techniques to navigate cultural and formal disparities. Strategies may include the substitution of culturally distant images with equivalent target-language metaphors or the creative reshaping of rhyme schemes to simulate the musicality of the original without rigid literalism....

What is at stake is not fidelity to word-for-word accuracy, but fidelity to reception. This demands that translators be attuned to the oral, performative, and emotive layers of the source text, and equally sensitive to the expectations and cognitive orientation of the target audience. In doing so, translation becomes less a transposition of words and more negotiation of aesthetic experience.
