Charles Darwin's encounter on Tierra del Fuego-his potted meat prodded by a local islander, prompting a shared but differently rooted revulsion-reveals not merely a clash of culinary cultures but the deeper, insidious duality of disgust. That Darwin recoiled not from dirt, but from the identity of the man touching his food, makes the moment a miniature study in how disgust is often less about hygiene than hierarchy, less about protection than projection.... Disgust, while ostensibly a biological safeguard, easily slips into the ideological, arbitrating between what is edible and what is alien.

At its evolutionary root, disgust arises from a paradox: survival demands eating, yet eating exposes us to invisible threats. Hence the core disgust triggers-bodily fluids, decayed flesh, excretions-are not random but biochemically prudent. Yet disgust does more than ward off pathogens; it obeys arcane rules of symbolic contamination. The laws of sympathetic magic-contagion and similarity-dictate that a sterilised cockroach briefly dipped into juice irrevocably damns the drink, that chocolate shaped like faeces remains uneaten, however hygienic. Disgust, unlike dislike, is infectious, irrevocable, and resistant to rational override.

This rigidity, biologically sensible in prehistoric environments, becomes a liability when it extends from pathogens to people. The disgust that guards against spoiled meat mutates, with little friction, into the rhetoric of purity used to dehumanise. The lexicon of bigotry-vermin, filth, infestation-draws directly from the affective palette of disgust. In modern history, disgust has not only shaped dietary boundaries but underpinned moral exclusion. The cultural disgust that targeted AIDS patients in the 1980s was not unlike that which renders sterilised insects inedible. In both cases, the reaction precedes evidence, resists correction, and cloaks itself in the aura of common sense.

Philosophers sceptical of disgust's moral authority argue that it is too easily co-opted by prejudice, too easily manipulated to justify cruelty. But the food domain has largely evaded this scrutiny. Perhaps because taste is viewed as private and immune to persuasion, there's an implicit belief that disgust in food is sacrosanct, even when it overlaps with cultural chauvinism. The adage De gustibus non est disputandum shields these judgments behind a veil of personal preference -yet such preferences are steeped in cultural conditioning. The slimy textures celebrated in Japanese 'neba-neba' foods repulse Western palates not because of inherent risk but unfamiliarity; disgust, here, functions as a heuristic for difference, not danger.

That heuristic is outdated in a globalised, industrial food system. With cultivated meats and insects emerging as sustainable alternatives, it is precisely disgust-irrational, entrenched, and performative-that hinders progress. People reject lab-grown meat not because it's unsafe, but because it feels wrong; they gag at crickets despite their nutrition, because cultural scripts declare them inedible. Disgust becomes inertia masquerading as instinct....

If disgust is shaped as much by belief as by biology, then the boundaries it draws are neither objective nor neutral. The cockroach is not rejected because it is dirty, but because it is symbolically unclean. In that case, the question is no longer whether disgust keeps us safe, but whether it keeps us blind. Perhaps it is time to admit that in our revulsion lies not just an immune response, but a refusal-to reconsider, to reimagine, to include.
