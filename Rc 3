Anyone who has dashed off an essay under time pressure knows the intense mental strain involved-something generative Al seems perfectly designed to alleviate.... Yet a recent MIT study suggests this very convenience might come at a neural cost. Students, both with and without ChatGPT assistance, were monitored via EEG while writing essays. Those using Al showed lower activation in areas linked to attention and creativity and struggled to recall what they themselves had just "written." A technologically lubricated process, it seems, leaves behind a thinner cognitive trace.

This aligns with a growing suspicion that generative Al, for all its immediate utility, may erode the deeper architecture of thinking. A Microsoft Research study, surveying 319 regular Al users across 900-plus work tasks, found that only a little over half the tasks required any real cognitive scrutiny-say, revising a poorly generated prompt or checking Al output before forwarding it to a client. The rest-summarising, rewording, drafting-were essentially cognitive autopilot. Users acknowledged a significant drop in mental effort when Al was involved, reporting that tasks simply felt "easier."

Michael Gerlich's work at SBS Swiss Business School offers a broader, population-level resonance. Asking 666 British participants to self-report Al usage and complete a critical- thinking test, he found that heavier Al users consistently underperformed. The implication: regular reliance on Al correlates with diminished analytical sharpness. After publication, Gerlich was inundated with messages from educators across schools and universities-teachers now confronting a generation of students who seem to be outsourcing not just effort, but thought itself.

Of course, none of this definitively proves causality. Perhaps individuals already low in cognitive confidence are more prone to Al dependency.... The MIT sample was small and the tasks narrow. Still, as Evan Risko, who coined the term "cognitive offloading," observes, Al doesn't merely handle dull tasks-it assumes ownership of entire reasoning chains. Offloading a sum to a calculator is one thing; offloading ideation, evaluation, and synthesis is another.

The danger is that this habit calcifies. Cognitive miserliness- the brain's instinct to conserve effort-can become entrenched. Gerlich warns of a feedback loop: the more one offloads, the less capable one becomes, prompting further offloading. One study participant confessed that after prolonged Al use, he no longer knew how to approach certain problems unaided.

Creativity, too, seems to flatten under Al's hand. In a University of Toronto study, participants asked to generate alternate uses for mundane objects produced more conventional responses after being exposed to Al suggestions. Asked about trousers, the Al proposed turning them into a scarecrow -essentially still trousers. A human, untethered, repurposed the pockets as a bird feeder.

Efforts to mitigate this drift include reconfiguring Al as an interrogator, not a provider. Microsoft is testing assistants that prompt users to reflect before offering help. Others recommend "cognitive forcing"-delaying Al access until the user has first attempted the task. But resistance is likely. A global survey found 47% would continue to use generative Al even if employers banned it.

The brain remains, for now, the more subtle instrument. Yet if Al dulls the very faculties it claims to empower, a reckoning may come-not with a ban, but with a quiet, collective forgetting of how we used to think.

Question No 1.

The author clarifies that the correlation between regular reliance on Al and diminished analytical sharpness may not necessarily imply causation because:

70

70

48651 1) the consequence may, in fact, be the cause.

2) multiple causal factors may be involved.

7004865

3) a third factor could have caused both.

4) it may be a temporal sequence without causation.

Question No 2.

"A human, untethered, repurposed the pockets as a bird feeder." This sentence suggests that:

1) human imagination offers more divergent ideas than Al does.

2) human creativity stays close to the original form and purpose.

3) human creativity is based on minimal mental exertion.

4) human creativity may be temporarily enhanced with the aid of Al.

Question No 3.

While offering solutions to the problems posed by Al reliance, the author implicitly believes that:

70

70

1) Al can encourage people to engage in unlawful actions.

2) Al can play a constructive role in cognitive tasks.

3) if not addressed, thinking may become the domain of Al. 70

4) Al service providers have a key role in addressing the issue.

Question No 4. All of the following is implied in the passage EXCEPT:

1) educational outcomes is strongly dependent on autonomous thought.

2) Al enables a pre-existing mental tendency to minimise exertion.

3) cognitive offloading leads to cognitive miserliness.

4) users gravitate towards Al due to the convenience it offers.
