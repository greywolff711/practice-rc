Think of the monk as a precursor to questions that theologians will be forced to consider in the coming decades. from being a niche concern, the fact that artificial intelligence will radically alter theology is of significance to all of us, regardless of our own beliefs and sectarian allegiances, because it will reshuffle the Sar meters and definitions of religion in potentially inconceivable ways. Theological concepts - regarding consciousness, individuality and agency - have both informed secular philosophy and been informed by it. Since theology is issues raised by Back up now

artificial intelligence, t

to pay attention to these questons now..

If an artificial intelligence - a computer, a robot, an android - is capable of complex thought, of reason, of emotion, then in what sense can it be said to have a soul? How does traditional religion react to a constructed person, at one remove from divine origins, and how are we to reconcile its role in the metaphysical order? Can we speak of salvation and damnation for digital beings? And is there any way in which we can evangelise robots or convert computers? Even for steadfast secularists and materialists, for whom those questions make no philosophical sense for humans, much less computers, that this will become a theological flashpoint for believers is something to anticipate, as it will doubtlessly have massive social, cultural, and political ramifications.

This is no scholastic issue of how many angels can dance on a silicon chip, since it seems inevitable that computer scientists will soon be able to develop an artificial intelligence that easily passes the Turing test, that surpasses the understanding of those who've programmed it. In an article for CNBC entitled 'Computers Will Be Like Humans By 2029' (2014), the journalist Cadie Thompson quotes Kurzweil, who confidently (if controversially) contends that 'computers will be at human levels, such as you can have a human relationship with them, 15 years from now.' With less than a decade left to go, Kurzweil explains that he's 'talking about emotional intelligence. The ability to tell a joke, to be funny, to be romantic, to be loving, to be sexy, that is the cutting edge of human intelligence, that is not a sideshow.'

Often grouped with other transhumanists who optimistically predict a coming millennium of digital transcendence, Kurzweil is a believer in what's often called the 'Singularity, the moment at which humanity's collective computing capabilities supersede our ability to understand the machines that we've created, and presumably, some sort of artificial consciousness develops. While bracketing out the details, let's assume that Kurzweil is broadly correct that, at some point in this century, an Al will develop that outstrips all past digital intelligences. If it's true that automata can then be as funny, romantic, [and] loving.. .as the best of us, it could also be assumed that they'd be capable of piety, reverence, and faith. When it's possible to make not just a wind-up clock monk, but computer that's actually capable of prayer, how then will faith respond?

Question No 15. Kurzweil's quote:

1) is used by the author to bolster their argument by providing a prediction that supports the conclusion.

2) acts as a qualifier to the author's argument by providing support while acknowledging potential limitations.

Each of the following, if true, would be a strong criticism against the author's arguments EXCEPT:

1) advanced Al, despite exhibiting human-like behaviours, cannot possess true consciousness.

2) religious doctrines are inherently adaptable and have historically integrated new scientific advancements without significant upheaval.

3) theological implications of Al are secondary to the pressing ethical and practical issues that Al 700 development currently presents.

4) even if secularists and materialists deal with the theological implications of Al, it cannot lead to any meaningful resolution.
