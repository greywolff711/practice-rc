[Olivia] Laing's savvy question-"Where does the money come from?"-is a driving inquiry of the [early chapters of her] book, The Garden Against Time: In Search of a Common Paradise. Such transparency of the economy doesn't always extend to the author's own resources. As a gardener myself, I have a scnse of how much money ii takes to buy large quantities of flower starts, compost, and other garden essentials-not to mention how much sweat equity. Upon my first reading of the book, there were several scenes in the author's garden for which my marginalia Back up now a penciled-in "$S$?!"

Still, while Laing may not share where her money comes from or how she finds the time to build an actual pond, the intimate moments when she collapses the historical into the personal and allows herself to become vulnerable have stuck in my mind like rose thorns. Laing shares her own experiences of refuge and displacement through the lenses of personal grief, political anger, and the trauma of internalized homophobia. Just as Eden is only one version of a garden, a memoir does not, need not, show an entire life. And the author is clear about which side of the garden gate she's on. She stands with the dispossessed-the underdogs, weirdos, and rebels who have, time and again, struggled to remake the relationships between people and the land. There's something revolutionary about the idea that a garden can be a private place, an island of beauty and respite, while also being, at the same time, a component of a larger archipelago of ideas in which land is used and tended with care, by and for the public good.

In the de facto climax of the memoir plotline, Laing readies her garden for an open house. It's part of a nationwide fundraiser for the National Health Service (NHS), in which members of the public pay a small fee to visit private gardens and have tea.... In perhaps the most HGTV moment of the book, Laing runs around in a planting frenzy, trying frantically to fill out the beds. She pulls it off. A small party assembles in the garden, attended by friends and people who knew Rumary, and Laing remarks that "it was probably the best day of [her] life: just for the feeling of looking in and seeing the garden so full of people, talking to each other, making themselves at home." The writer is aware that the scene is a far cry from Morris's imagined socialist revolution. But it's something to nurture, something that might grow.

In a sense, the kinds of conversations and community-making Laing experienced that day are already bearing fruit. The Garden Against Time joins a recent wave of books by nonbinary people and women writing about their personal relationships with the natural world amid the larger context of the climate crisis.... I think we're all interested in the different ways in which, despite humanity's best/worst efforts, the more-than-human world still carries and exerts power in people's lives: how our bodies are also natural bodies. The mycelial networks are doing their job.
