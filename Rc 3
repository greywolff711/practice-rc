The word “surreal” is a common linguistic property. . . . Useful as it may be, “surreal” is, on closer inspection, something of a misnomer. It comes from the French surréalisme, which translates into English as “super-realism”. . . . But surrealism—as a style—is not hyper-realistic or ultra-realistic. It’s just the opposite, in fact. . . . In real life, you won’t find lobsters on telephone cradles, clock-faces that flop over table-ends like soft-fried eggs.

The term, art history records, originated in Parisian studios and manifestos in the early 1920s. Surrealism’s founders were André Breton, Louis Aragon, Salvador Dali, Max Ernst, Marcel Duchamp, Yves Tanguy, Man Ray—a coterie of internal and external exiles. It was, initially, as much a literary as an artistic movement and, as such, produced wonderfully effective publicity for itself. Mediocre as some of the later products are—avoid, for example, that dreary Dali exhibition down on London’s South Bank—surrealism has always generated first-rate PR.

Later than much of Europe, Britain began to wake up to surrealism in the summer of 1936, with the International Surrealist Exhibition at London’s New Burlington Gallery. . . . On the opening day, the crush was so great that traffic in Piccadilly was brought to a standstill. All the big foreign names were there. The event was immortalised by Salvador Dali giving a lecture in a deep-sea diving suit. Famously, he had to be extracted, suffocating, from his metal helmet with pliers. It is not recorded whether the lecture was otherwise a success. That image was lodged in the British mind as a defining icon. The press spluttered with universal indignation at this “practical joke” on the British people. . . .

Surrealism in the pre-war years was not merely an art movement. It had political muscle. Walter Benjamin, the great Marxist critic, hailed its rupture of traditional connections as revolutionary. Surrealism was a necessary jolt to the bourgeois world. It disconnected things. Dali, in his less frivolous moments, proclaimed paranoia and nightmares the truly creative and truth-telling mental conditions. These were the rich codes of the unconscious in which surrealism spoke. Breton called the artists’ language “psychic automatism”. You can track Freud and his Interpretation of Dreams everywhere in surrealism’s snow. . . .

In Britain surrealism was promoted by Roland Penrose (then an artist, later an art world panjandrum) and the anarchist critic Herbert Read (motto: “To hell with culture!”). They were the organisers of the 1936 exhibition. But surrealism, like Marxism, never took root in the UK. Not English, as Mr Podsnap would say. Nor would it find a home in the countries of the fascist axis (Germany, Spain, Italy), where it was firmly placed in the category of Goebbels’ Entartete Kunst, degenerate art. Nicht Deutsch, either. In Britain, only a handful of names are routinely cited as having been practitioners of surrealism or, to some degree, influenced by it: Humphrey Jennings, Graham Sutherland, Lucian Freud, Francis Bacon. . . .

Surrealism was obstinately resisted by the postwar Britain in which I grew up. Social realism of the kitchen-sink variety was the favoured mode—even among the rebellious young. When Dali’s Crucifixion went on display in Glasgow, it was attacked by an enraged MacPodsnap with an umbrella. Nae Scottish. Britain, as in so many things, would not be ready for surrealism until it was safely passé.

Whales, those grand denizens of the deep, showcase an impressive array of evolutionary adaptations that have enabled them to dominate marine ecosystems. Among their most distinctive adaptations is the blowhole, a specialized respiratory structure that evolved over millions of years. Located on the top of their heads, the blowhole allows whales to breathe air efficiently while mostly submerged, a critical feature for animals that inhabit vast, open waters. The structure of the blowhole varies among different whale species, each variation tailored to meet specific ecological demands. For instance, toothed whales such as dolphins and killer whales have a single blowhole, which is ideal for quick, frequent surfacing. In contrast, baleen whales, including the massive blue whale and the extensive fin whale, possess two blowholes, enabling them to inhale a greater volume of air to support their larger bodies and filter-feeding lifestyle.

This variation in blowhole architecture is not merely a physical trait but is deeply integrated into the whales’ behavioural patterns and sensory capabilities. Marine biologist Conor Ryan, in his research published in Biology Letters, delves into the fascinating hypothesis that the dual blowholes of baleen whales might enable a form of “stereo smelling.” This adaptation could be pivotal in their navigation of the often murky and visually obscure oceanic environments where they reside, enhancing their ability to detect scent gradients that lead to food sources. Such a capability could guide baleen whales directly toward dense gatherings of zooplankton, the tiny, shrimp-like organisms that form the bulk of their diet.

The feeding behaviour of baleen whales involves sweeping through vast volumes of seawater, which they filter through their baleen plates to capture the minuscule zooplankton. Unlike their toothed relatives, who employ echolocation to hunt down each prey, baleen whales are likely to utilize olfactory cues to locate large congregations of zooplankton. These organisms feed on phytoplankton, which releases dimethyl sulphide when consumed—a chemical that acts as a beacon, drawing baleen whales to rich feeding sites. The ability to detect such chemical signals indicates a complex olfactory system in baleen whales that, though different from those of terrestrial mammals, is vital for their foraging and overall survival.

The concept of stereoscopic senses is well understood in terrestrial animals; for example, having two eyes helps with depth perception, and two ears assist in pinpointing the direction of sounds. This concept may apply uniquely to baleen whales, whose spaced blowholes could provide a nuanced perception of smell. This ability would be invaluable in their vast, aqueous environment, enabling them to determine the direction from which scent signals emanate accurately.

To further investigate this hypothesis, Dr. Ryan utilized cutting-edge drone technology to take detailed photographs of the nostrils of 143 whales across 14 different species. His analysis suggests that those species that primarily feed on zooplankton have blowholes that are set further apart than those of other whales. This arrangement not only maximizes their respiratory efficiency when they surface but may also enhance their capability to discern the location of their next meal. This dual functionality of the blowhole is a prime example of the intricate evolutionary solutions that whales have developed to navigate and exploit their underwater environments effectively.


Question No 5.
Which one of the following, if true, would best complement the passage’s findings?
1)  Baleen whales increase the frequency of their vocalizations when in the presence of high concentrations of zooplankton.
2)  Baleen whales adjust their migratory routes based on seasonal variations in the concentration of dimethyl sulphide in oceanic regions.
3)  Baleen whales exhibit a consistent preference for navigating between shallow coastal waters and deep oceanic environments.
4)  Baleen whales demonstrate the capability to selectively close one blowhole to enhance water filtration through their baleen plates during feeding.


Which one of the following cannot be inferred from Dr. Conor Ryan’s study?
1)  Killer whales do not rely primarily on stereo-smelling to hunt their prey.
2)  The distance between blowholes correlates with the whale species’ primary diet.
3)  Sense of sound does not play much role in baleen whales’ foraging behaviour.
4)  Baleen whales can use olfactory cues to feed on any zooplankton congregations.

Question No 7.
Which one of the following implications regarding the sensory capabilities of baleen whales could be considered a potential extension of the findings discussed by Dr. Conor Ryan?
1)  The stereo-smelling capability of baleen whales may allow them to discern not only the presence but also the density of zooplankton clusters at varying depths.
2)  Baleen whales’ stereo-smelling might be complemented by a lesser-known auditory system that helps pinpoint the exact location of zooplankton swarms.
3)  Baleen whales could potentially adjust their diving depth based on the clarity of the water to maximize visual perception of zooplankton.
4)  Baleen whales might exhibit the ability to recognize individual chemical signatures of different species of zooplankton, enabling them to choose specific prey.
 View Solution
All of the following are capabilities of baleen whales described in the passage EXCEPT:
1)  can hunt their prey even in dirty waters.
2)  their blowholes allow them to maintain their large size.
3)  capable of using blowholes to hunt highly mobile marine species.
4)  has evolutionary advantage due to distinctive adaptations.


There are two extreme ways to structure “moreness.” At one extreme, you can construct a system as a long string of sequential operations, such as we do in a meandering factory assembly line. The internal logic of a clock, as it measures off time by a complicated parade of movements, is the archetype of a sequential system. Most mechanical systems follow the clock. At the other far extreme, we find many systems ordered as a patchwork of parallel operations, very much as in the neural network of a brain or in a colony of ants. Action in these systems proceeds in a messy cascade of interdependent events. Instead of the discrete ticks of cause and effect that run a clock, a thousand clock springs try to simultaneously run a parallel system. Since there is no chain of command, the particular action of any single spring diffuses into the whole, making it easier for the sum of the whole to overwhelm the parts of the whole. What emerges from the collective is not a series of critical individual actions but a multitude of simultaneous actions whose collective pattern is far more important. This is the swarm model. . . .

It seems that the things we find most interesting in the universe are all dwelling near the web end. We have the web of life, the tangle of the economy, the mob of societies, and the jungle of our own minds. As dynamic wholes, these all share certain characteristics: a certain liveliness, for one. We know these parallel-operating wholes by different names. We know a swarm of bees, or a cloud of modems, or a network of brain neurons, or a food web of animals, or a collective of agents. The class of systems to which all of the above belong is variously called: networks, complex adaptive systems, swarm systems, vivisystems, or collective systems. . . .

Organizationally, each of these is a collection of many (thousands) of autonomous members. “Autonomous” means that each member reacts individually according to internal rules and the state of its local environment. This is opposed to obeying orders from a center, or reacting in lock step to the overall environment. These autonomous members are highly connected to each other, but not to a central hub. They thus form a peer network. Since there is no center of control, the management and heart of the system are said to be decentrally distributed within the system, as a hive is administered. . . .

As our inventions shift from the linear, predictable, causal attributes of the mechanical motor, to the crisscrossing, unpredictable, and fuzzy attributes of living systems, we need to shift our sense of what we expect from our machines. A simple rule of thumb may help: For jobs where supreme control is demanded, good old clockware is the way to go. Where supreme adaptability is required, out-ofcontrol swarmware is what you want. For each step we push our machines toward the collective, we move them toward life. . . . The more we can discover about the mathematical properties of generic swarm processing, the better our understanding will be of both artificial complexity and biological complexity.

It can be inferred from the passage that swarm systems:
1)  lack organizational structure.
2)  lack direction in operation.
3)  lack management system.
4)  lack principal coordinating unit.
The term “moreness”, as used in the passage, most likely implies which of the following?
1)  how well a system should be structured so as to enhance autonomy and efficiency
2)  how well a system can amplify capabilities beyond individual component functions
3)  how well a system may be designed to be capable of having more sophisticated control
4)  how well a system enhances the parts of the whole as opposed to the sum of the whole
None of the following is implied by the arguments in the passage EXCEPT:
1)  for autonomous systems, coordination among members plays a minor role in the system’s functionality.
2)  systems that use sequential operations have little utility in situations where causal connections are important.
3)  there is a trend towards that machines may need to operate in ways that are not always perfectly controlled.
4)  real-life systems are either based on sequential operations or based on parallel operations.


Based on the information set out in the passage, each of the following can likely be disadvantages of swarm system EXCEPT:
1)  it is difficult to understand exactly how it functions.
2)  there could be a duplication of effort by the individual component.
3)  failure of individual components could disrupt the whole system.
4)  it cannot be used in situations where foreseeability is important.
