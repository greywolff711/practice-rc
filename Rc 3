The proliferation of self-checkout systems in retail establishments is one specific illustration of how advances in technology are having an effect on the labour market. In many retail establishments, the need for human cashiers has been eliminated thanks to the introduction of automated systems. Customers no longer need the assistance of a cashier in order to scan and pay for the items they purchase. Despite the fact that this technology makes shopping more convenient and saves time for consumers, it has led to a decrease in the demand for cashier positions. Retailers are increasingly adopting self-checkout systems, which has resulted in the displacement of a large number of cashiers who previously relied on these roles for employment. Retailers are being driven by the desire to save money and improve productivity.

Another prominent example lies in the transportation industry, where autonomous vehicles are poised to transform the labour market. Companies like Tesla, Google's Waymo, and Uber are investing heavily in developing self-driving technology. While autonomous vehicles offer the promise of enhanced safety and efficiency on the roads, they also have the potential to disrupt the livelihoods of millions of truck drivers, taxi drivers, and delivery drivers. As self-driving technology advances and becomes more reliable, it is expected that the need for human drivers will diminish significantly, potentially leading to substantial job losses within the transportation sector.

The effects of automation are not uniformly felt across all industries and tiers of technical expertise. The manufacturing industry offers a compelling example of this phenomenon. Over the course of the last few decades, the use of industrial robots on factory floors has become increasingly commonplace. As a result of these machines' ability to perform labour-intensive and repetitive tasks with speed and accuracy, the number of human workers required in assembly lines can be reduced. As a direct consequence of this, factory workers who were formerly in charge of activities such as welding, assembly, and packaging have been subjected to significant job displacement. The automation of manufacturing processes has resulted in the loss of certain jobs and has made it necessary to acquire new skills in order to maintain one's relevance in the ever-shifting employment

landscape.

Moreover, technological advancements have also given rise to the gig economy, which has further transformed the labour market. Online platforms and mobile applications have made it easier for individuals to participate in freelance work, creating opportunities for flexible employment. For instance, platforms like Uber, Lyft, and TaskRabbit allow individuals to provide transportation services, run errands, or offer various

skills on demand. While this flexibility can be advantageous

for certain individuals seeking a supplemental income or a flexible work schedule, it also brings about challenges in terms of job security and stability. Gig workers are often classified as independent contractors, meaning they do not have access to the same benefits and protections as traditional employees, such as healthcare, retirement plans, or paid time off. This lack of social protections leaves gig workers vulnerable to income volatility and financial insecurity
