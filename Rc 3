The idea that humour is uniquely human is increasingly under question. From apes poking and slamming each other in zoos to rats squealing when tickled, a growing body of observations suggests that elements of comedy, playfulness, and even mischief may exist across species-not just as random quirks, but as evolutionarily embedded behaviours.

In an extensive study, Isabelle Laumer and her colleagues at UCLA reviewed over 75 hours of footage capturing great apes -chimpanzees, gorillas, bonobos, and orangutans-engaging in daily routines within zoo enclosures.... Across all four species, they identified 18 types of teasing: poking, hair- pulling, obstructing movement, slapping, body-slamming. Juveniles often targeted inattentive adults-prodding them repeatedly, watching for responses, and escalating their antics when ignored. This behaviour wasn't accidental; it was persistent, intentional, and tuned to the reactions of others. It mirrored the calculated provocations of human children- those impish acts done with a grin and an eye on their audience.

These episodes blur the boundary between play and manipulation. Teasing here wasn't aggression-it was performative and interactive, suggesting a cognitive framework where anticipation of others' reactions matters. The researchers suggest this reflects basic forms of "theory of mind"-the ability to gauge perspective, violate expectations, and monitor social norms, all foundational to human humour. That all great apes demonstrate such behaviours hints that our shared ancestor 13 million years ago may have possessed the roots of humour....

But the phenomenon isn't limited to primates. Darwin, in The Descent of Man, described dogs who pretend to let go of a stick, only to snatch it back the moment their human reaches for it-a trick executed not for survival, but apparent amusement. Contemporary ethologists like Marc Bekoff echo this. In decades of observation, he's documented teasing in dogs, foxes, coyotes, and wolves. A typical move: one animal bounds up with a relaxed, exaggerated gait, invites a chase, and darts away-pure provocation, seemingly for fun...

Beyond mammals, parrots have been caught whistling to mislead household dogs, and dolphins emit squeals during mock fights. Elephants trumpet during play, not as warning but in joyful exuberance. Even rats, long dismissed as instinct- driven, reveal unexpected playfulness. At Northwestern University, Jeffrey Burgdorf has spent years tickling rats. The animals emit high-pitched vocalisations-a kind of ultrasonic giggle-whenever touched, return for more, and can even be trained to play hide and seek for a tickling reward. These reactions aren't flukes; studies show tickled rats exhibit increased brain activity linked to positive emotion and learning. Neuroscientist Jaak Panksepp called play "fertiliser for the brain"-stimulating new connections, sharpening cognition, and enhancing social engagement.

Proving humour is elusive. Are these creatures joking-or simply using play to initiate interaction, defuse conflict, or grab attention?... In two-dog households, one dog might fake an alert at the door to steal the other's meal. Is this deception with a wink, or mere learned behaviour?...

What's clear is that play, teasing, and laughter-like behaviours are not incidental-they appear across taxa and may serve powerful social functions. If, in humans, laughter bonds and disarms, could the same mechanism be at work in the jungle, forest, or lab cage? The answer may not be a punchline, but it's certainly worth listening for.

Question No 15.

Which of the following can be reasonably inferred as a shared feature of Darwin's dog example and Burgdorf's rat study?

1) Both involved behaviours that playfully subverted another's expectations.

2) Both involved observable evidence linking the behaviour to neurological activity.

3) Both involved actions that contributed to social bonding within the same species.

4) Both involved behaviours that 0 appeared to be motivated by enjoyment.

Question No To.

What does the author most likely intend by saying, "The answer may not be a punchline, but it's certainly worth listening for"?

1) The author believes that while humour is probably unique to humans, animal sounds may still mimic its outward form.

2) The author acknowledges that the observed behaviours may be coincidental but still warrant scientific attention.

3) The author concedes that animal humour may never be fully proven but remains an intriguing line of inquiry.

4) The author suggests that humorous intent in animals is likely absent, yet the behaviours continue to invite speculation
