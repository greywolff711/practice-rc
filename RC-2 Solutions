Question Explanation:
The question asks which of the provided inferences is not supported by the details in the passage about surrealism and its reception, especially in Britain. To determine the correct answer, we need to critically analyse each statement and check whether there is information in the passage that supports or refutes it. The aim is to find the statement that lacks support from the passage.
Correct Answer:
4. “the failure of surrealism in Britain is due to the disillusionment towards modernity.” This statement posits that a general disillusionment with modernity led to the failure of surrealism in Britain. The passage, however, offers different reasons for the resistance to surrealism in Britain, notably its un-English character and alignment with perceived degenerate art, alongside a cultural preference for more traditional art forms post-war. The text mentions surrealism’s political and revolutionary nature and its misalignment with prevailing cultural and artistic norms in Britain but does not link its failure specifically to disillusionment with modernity as a broader concept. Thus, this option is not supported by the passage, and it is the correct answer.
Incorrect Answer:
1. “there were instances of cultural resistance to art that challenged the norm.” This inference is well-supported by multiple examples in the passage. It describes how Salvador Dali’s lecture in a diving suit was perceived as a practical joke, indicating resistance to surrealism’s unconventional methods. Furthermore, the attack on Dali’s painting in Glasgow by an individual with an umbrella underscores direct physical resistance against art that challenged societal norms.
2. “founders of surrealism were marketers of their own style.” The passage explicitly supports this inference by detailing how surrealism was as much a literary as an artistic movement at its inception, which produced effective publicity for itself. The mention of surrealist founders and their active promotion of the movement, including through grand events like the International Surrealist Exhibition, illustrates their role as marketers of their artistic style.
3. “post-war Britain saw a societal retreat to more conservative art forms.” The text supports this statement by describing the post-war preference for social realism and the kitchen-sink variety, which are more conservative and traditional compared to the avant-garde and revolutionary nature of surrealism. This shift in artistic preference shows a societal retreat to more conventional forms, contrasting sharply with the earlier experimental phase represented by surrealism.

Question Explanation:
The question seeks to identify the significance of two surreal images mentioned in the passage: ‘lobsters on telephone cradles’ and ‘clock-faces that flop over table-ends like soft-fried eggs.’ To answer accurately, we must interpret these images within the context provided by the passage, focusing on how they exemplify the principles and artistic methods of surrealism as described.
Correct Answer:
1. “descriptions of paintings depicted in surrealist art” is the correct choice. The surreal images mentioned are typical of the surrealist art movement, characterised by bizarre, dream-like scenarios that challenge conventional reality. The passage discusses surrealism as originating from a blend of literary and artistic movements, known for its striking and unconventional imagery intended to disrupt the mundane perception of reality. These specific images—though not directly tied to known works of Dali within the text—serve as quintessential examples of how surrealism manifests in visual art: placing everyday objects in unexpected, irrational contexts to create a jarring, dream-like effect. This interpretation aligns with the overall description of surrealism in the passage, highlighting its aim to subvert and redefine reality through art.
Incorrect Answer:
2. “depiction of the fluidity of human perception” could be inferred as a secondary theme in surrealism, as the movement often explores the boundaries of perception and reality. However, the passage does not specifically connect these images to the concept of fluid perception. Instead, it focuses more on the visual and thematic shock value of surrealism, rather than a philosophical or psychological exploration of perception.
3. “misunderstood artworks of surrealism” is not directly supported because the passage does not imply that these particular images were misunderstood. It suggests that surrealism itself faced resistance and was seen as controversial, but it does not attribute misunderstanding specifically to these images. The discussion centres more on surrealism’s impact and reception rather than public misinterpretation of specific artworks.
4. “examples of the French word surréalisme” is incorrect because it misinterprets the role of these images. While the passage explains that surrealism translates to ‘super-realism,’ these images do not serve as examples of the word but illustrate the style and artistic approach of surrealism. They are not linguistic examples but visual demonstrations of surrealism’s core artistic principles.

Question Explanation:
This question requires identifying which statement about Britain’s relationship with surrealism, as described in the passage, is true. The question asks us to isolate the one accurate description among options that are otherwise untrue based on the passage’s content.
Correct Answer:
2. “Britain tends to adopt artistic movements only after they are no longer cutting-edge.” This is the correct choice, as the passage directly supports this notion by detailing how surrealism was not readily accepted or popular in Britain until it was “safely passé.” The passage also illustrates that Britain was generally late in engaging with surrealism compared to much of Europe, with significant interest only beginning around the 1936 exhibition. The broader context of the passage suggests a pattern where Britain is resistant to avant-garde movements until they lose their revolutionary edge, aligning with this statement.
Incorrect Answer:
1. “Britain suppressed surrealistic art as it was seen as a threat to the cultural fabric.” The passage does not claim that surrealistic art was actively suppressed due to being viewed as a threat. Instead, it mentions resistance and lack of acceptance, which is different from an organised or governmental suppression aimed at protecting cultural fabric.
3. “Britain saw the rebellious young favouring surrealism despite societal resistance.”
The passage contradicts this statement by noting that even the rebellious young favoured social realism over surrealism in the post-war period. It highlights a societal inclination towards more conservative and traditional forms like the kitchen-sink variety, rather than a preference for surrealism among the youth.
4. “Britain’s version of surrealism aimed at disrupting the prevalent political landscape.”
Although surrealism had political undertones and was seen as revolutionary elsewhere, the passage does not indicate that the British adoption of surrealism had a deliberate aim to disrupt the political landscape. The focus in Britain seems more on surrealism’s cultural and artistic aspects rather than its political implications.

Question Explanation:
This question centres on why the author references Goebbels’ “Entartete Kunst” (degenerate art) in relation to surrealism. Understanding the context in which this term is used helps clarify its function in the discussion about surrealism’s reception and impact, particularly in fascist countries.
Correct Answer:
3. “highlight the exclusion of surrealism from the norms of fascist nations.”
This choice is the most accurate based on the passage. The mention of Goebbels’ Entartete Kunst serves to illustrate the ideological and cultural rejection of surrealism by the fascist regimes of Germany, Spain, and Italy. The passage notes that surrealism was categorised as degenerate art, which implies a strong, official disapproval and exclusion from the accepted cultural norms under these regimes. This term specifically connotes the Nazi regime’s campaign against what it deemed culturally corrupt or politically undesirable art, effectively categorising surrealism as unacceptable within their cultural policy.
Incorrect Answer:
1. “illustrate the fascist axis’ condemnation of ideologies such as Marxism.”
While it’s true that fascist regimes condemned Marxism and associated ideologies, the specific mention of Entartete Kunst in the passage focuses on the art movement itself, not directly on its ideological ties to Marxism. The term is used more to discuss the cultural policy toward art than a broad ideological condemnation.
2. “present how fascist regimes amended surrealism to suit their dogmas.”
This statement is incorrect as there is no indication in the passage that fascist regimes attempted to amend or adapt surrealism to fit their ideologies. Instead, they outright rejected it as part of their broader rejection of certain modernist art forms. 4. “underscore the failure of surrealism to have a widespread impact.”
Although surrealism’s limited impact in certain regions is a theme in the passage, the specific reference to Entartete Kunst is not used to underscore its overall failure but rather to highlight its rejection by specific totalitarian regimes. The context of this mention is more about rejection and exclusion than about the general success or failure of the movement.
