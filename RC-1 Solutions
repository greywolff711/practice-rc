Question Explanation:
This question asks about the meaning behind the author’s statement regarding “people’s tendency to confuse the various entities to which a given mentalistic explanation may be applied.” To answer this, one must understand how the author describes the common mistakes people make when interpreting explanations related to mental states and behaviours, particularly in the context of evolutionary biology. The passage highlights the importance of distinguishing between different entities—such as genes, organisms, and minds—and not conflating their motives or behaviours.
Correct Answer:
3. People mistakenly attribute the motives of genes to the motives of entire organisms or individual minds. This option is the best fit because it directly addresses the core issue presented by the author. Throughout the passage, the author provides examples of how people incorrectly project the selfish motives of genes onto the behaviours of organisms and individuals. For instance, the misunderstanding of Dawkins’ “self ish genes” leading to the erroneous belief that organisms (and humans) are inherently selfish is a clear instance of this confusion. The author explains that genes’ “self ishness” manifests through complex behaviours that can include altruism at the organism level, thus distinguishing the genes’ motives from those of the organism or individual mind.
Incorrect Answer:
1. People often misunderstand the difference between selfish and selfless behaviours in organisms.
This option is incorrect because the main issue discussed by the author is not about misunderstanding behaviours directly, but rather about misattributing the motives behind those behaviours. While the passage does mention the compatibility of selfish genes with selfless organisms, the core confusion the author addresses is deeper, involving the projection of genetic motives onto organisms’ behaviours.
2. People fail to distinguish between the conscious goals of individuals and the unconscious goals of their genes.
The author’s point is broader than just conscious versus unconscious goals. The author emphasizes the misattribution of motives across different levels of biological organization (genes, organisms, minds) rather than merely the nature of those goals (conscious or unconscious).
4. People confuse the scientific explanations provided by evolutionary biology with sociobiological concepts.
This option is incorrect because the passage does not discuss the confusion between evolutionary biology and sociobiology as disciplines. Instead, it focuses on the misunderstanding of how motives and goals at the genetic level are mistakenly attributed to the level of whole organisms or individual minds. The author is concerned with the misinterpretation within the framework of evolutionary biology, not between different scientific concepts.

Question Explanation:
This question asks for the main argument of the passage. To identify this, one needs to consider the overall point the author is making about the common misunderstandings in interpreting evolutionary biology, particularly regarding the motives of genes versus the behaviours and motives of organisms and minds.
Correct Answer:
1. understanding evolutionary biology needs distinguishing the motives of genes and individuals. This answer accurately captures the central argument of the passage. The author emphasizes that a significant barrier to understanding the insights of evolutionary biology in relation to the human mind is the tendency to confuse the motives of genes with those of organisms and individuals. The passage explains that genes and individuals have different goals and motives, and this distinction is crucial for correctly interpreting behaviours and avoiding common fallacies.
Incorrect Answer:
2. the concept of selfish genes is misinterpreted as implying selfish behaviour in organisms.
This option touches on an important point made in the passage but is too narrow to be considered the main argument. While the author does discuss the misinterpretation of selfish genes, this is used as an example to illustrate the broader issue of confusing the motives of genes with those of organisms.
3. sociobiology is misunderstood due to the complexity of behaviours that don’t directly spread genes.
This option is incorrect because it focuses on a specif ic aspect of misunderstanding (sociobiology and behaviours that don’t spread genes) rather than the overarching theme of distinguishing between the motives of genes and individuals. The passage addresses sociobiology as an example of the larger problem of misattribution of motives.
4. evolutionary psychology should avoid using mentalistic terms to prevent confusion.
This option is incorrect because the author argues against the proscription of mentalistic terms in behaviourism and evolutionary psychology as long as there is a clear distinction between dif ferent levels (genes, organisms, minds). The author believes that using mentalistic terms can be insightful if applied correctly, rather than suggesting they should be avoided.

Question Explanation:
This question seeks to understand the author’s interpretation of Richard Dawkins’ portrayal of “selfish genes.” The passage discusses common misconceptions about the concept and clarifies how the selfishness of genes does not necessarily translate to selfishness in organisms. The correct answer will accurately reflect the nuanced explanation the author provides regarding the relationship between genes’ motives and organisms’ behaviours.
Correct Answer:
4. while genes are selfish, organisms can be altruistic.
This answer captures the core of the author’s explanation of Dawkins’ concept. In the passage, the author points out that the idea of “selfish genes” is often misunderstood to mean that organisms themselves are selfish. However, the author clarifies that selfish genes can lead to the evolution of altruistic behaviours in organisms. For instance, genes that promote altruistic behaviour towards relatives can increase the overall genetic fitness, thereby aiding the selfish replication goals of the genes. The author uses this to illustrate the distinction between the genetic level (where selfishness lies) and the organismal level (where altruism can occur).
Incorrect Answer:
1. organisms and genes are inherently selfish.
This option is incorrect because it conflates the selfish nature of genes with the behaviour of organisms. The author explicitly argues against this misunderstanding, stating that while genes operate selfishly to replicate, this does not imply that organisms are inherently selfish. In fact, organisms can exhibit self less or altruistic behaviours that ultimately serve the genes’ replication goals.
2. people are confused about the sociobiology of genes.
While this statement reflects a broader theme in the passage, it does not specifically address Dawkins’ portrayal of “self ish genes.” The author’s discussion about Dawkins is more focused on clarifying the specific misconception that selfish genes imply selfish organisms, rather than a general confusion about sociobiology.

3. organism’s behaviour is independent of genes.
This option is incorrect because it inaccurately suggests that the author believes there is no connection between genes and organisms’ behaviours. The passage makes it clear that genes significantly influence behaviours, but these behaviours (such as altruism) can serve the genes’ selfish goals indirectly. The correct interpretation recognizes the influence of genes while distinguishing the apparent behaviours at the organismal level.

Question Explanation:
This question aims to understand the author’s view on sociobiology and the application of a Freudian mindset in interpreting evolutionary psychology. To answer it correctly, one must consider how the author discusses the common misunderstandings associated with sociobiology and how applying Freudian concepts leads to misleading interpretations in the context of evolutionary biology.
Correct Answer:
1. the former is misunderstood; the latter is misleading. This option accurately encapsulates the author’s views. The author explains that sociobiology is frequently misunderstood, particularly in the context of behaviours that do not appear to directly contribute to gene replication, such as adopting children or using contraception. These misunderstandings stem from confusion between the goals of genes and the behaviours of organisms. Furthermore, the author argues that applying a Freudian mindset to evolutionary psychology is misleading. People tend to think of genes as the deepest, truest essence of a person, attributing human-like motives to them. This mindset causes confusion between the motives of genes and the motives of individuals, leading to significant misconceptions about the nature of behaviour and evolutionary processes. Thus, the Freudian perspective is not just irrelevant but actively misleading.
Incorrect Answer:
2. the former is misinterpreted; the latter is irrelevant.
This option is incorrect because, while the author does suggest that sociobiology is of ten misinterpreted, they do not imply that the Freudian mindset is irrelevant. On the contrary, the author describes the Freudian mindset as misleading, which has a significant negative impact on understanding evolutionary psychology.
3. the former is flawed; the latter is ambiguous.
This option is incorrect because the author does not argue that sociobiology itself is f lawed; rather, the misunderstanding lies in how people interpret it. Additionally, the author does not describe the Freudian mindset as ambiguous but as actively misleading in the context of evolutionary psychology.
4. the former is inaccurate; the latter is flawed.
This option is incorrect because the author does not suggest that sociobiology is inaccurate. Instead, the author highlights that sociobiology is often misunderstood. Similarly, the author does not describe the Freudian mindset as simply f lawed but as misleading. The passage emphasizes how this mindset leads to misconceptions by conflating the motives of genes with those of individuals.
